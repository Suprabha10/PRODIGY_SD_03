This repository contains the code and documentation for Task 3 of my Software Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
# SUMMARY ABOUT THE TASK
The task involves developing a Contact Management System using Python's Tkinter library to create an interactive graphical user interface (GUI). The system is designed to store contacts in a JSON file named `contacts.json`, which ensures that the data persists across sessions. It includes several key functions: `load_contacts()` to load existing contacts from the file, `save_contacts(contacts)` to save updated contact information, `add_contact()` to add new contacts while ensuring all fields (name, phone, email) are filled, `edit_contact()` to load a selected contactâ€™s details into input fields for editing, and `delete_contact()` to remove the selected contact from the list.

The user interface is organized into different frames. The top frame contains labels and entry fields for the contact's name, phone number, and email address. Below this, a button frame holds buttons for adding, editing, and deleting contacts, each connected to their respective functions. The bottom part of the interface contains a listbox, which displays the names of all saved contacts, along with a vertical scrollbar for navigation. The listbox is dynamically updated whenever a contact is added, edited, or deleted.

The main window of the application is fixed at a specific size (400x500 pixels) and is not resizable, ensuring a consistent user experience. Overall, this system provides users with an intuitive way to manage contact information, with real-time updates to the contact list and persistent storage to maintain data integrity across multiple uses.
